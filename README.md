This is the official [Rayne](http://rayne3d.com) documentation project. It's released under the CC0 license (see the LICENSE.md file for more information). Issues and pull requests are welcome :)

## Building

The documentation is written in ReStructuredText against [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org), so you need Sphinx to compile the documentation. If you are using Sublime Text to edit the documentation, the project already includes a build script to automatically invoke the makefile and build the HTML documentation.
