Rayne wouldn't have been possible without the tremendous support from various people. This page is dedicated to these people and to thank them accordingly. In no order whatsoever (lies!), we would like to thank...

  * ... Our girlfriends for accepting that we didn't always have time for them
  * ... Felix Pohl for bringing Rayne to life in the first place (and then continuously giving us feedback)
  * ... Our families, because without them, we wouldn't be where we are right now (because we wouldn't have been born. Duh).
  * ... Reddit and the Gamestudio forum for their feedback
  * ... You, for reading this (Mom, Dad! The Time's person of the year 2006 is reading what we wrote!!!)
